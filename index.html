<h1>Facing my fear, Giant swing</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am an adventurous&nbsp;person by nature. Since my second year at my college, when I was doing an internship in Hyderabad,&nbsp; I have been doing various adventure activities like rock climbing, hiking, rappelling. If you want to do something fun activity, I am your man. The adrenaline&nbsp;rush, I just yearn for it. I even spent three days in a jungle, camping and drinking water from a waterfall. Last year I did scuba diving as well as paragliding. But there was an adventure activity I thought I could never do, that is bungee&nbsp;jumping.&nbsp;I guess everybody knows what&nbsp;a bungee jumping is, where you have to jump from a bridge, almost 100 meter high, with a rope tied to your body. I thought I don't&nbsp;have the courage to the endure the free fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After graduation, I joined Samsung and&nbsp;when three of my friends booked tickets for bungee, I was very skeptical. There is only one organization, called Jumping Heights which conduct the event. You have to book the slots at least before 3 days to do Bunjee as it is extremely&nbsp;popular.&nbsp;I was so afraid, that I did not book the slot. I thought I will just watch people doing it, maybe I will gather courage and next time I will be able to do it. Let's just watch this time. I planned to do rafting, which also I did never before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my friends booked their slots and we&nbsp;made all the necessary travel arrangements. On the D day, we booked the bus and next morning&nbsp;we reached Rishikesh. We booked a cab and went to a small village, Mohanchatti, where Jumping height conducts the bungee jumping. My first memory was a small girl jumping with her two hands wide open, with a wide smile on her face, enjoying every moment of the jump. I wondered how can one be so courageous. Why I, a 23-year-old&nbsp;guy doesn't&nbsp;have same courage?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We checked into the cafeteria, where giant screens were screening people of all age, all gender performing Bungee. I saw 10-15 people doing the same. I thought why can't I?&nbsp;I gathered courage and decided I am not leaving this spot without doing something exciting and memorable for rest of my life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I asked the manager&nbsp;of the resort, I need to do the Bunjee. He smiled and said the slots are all filled, but you can do giant swing instead. Both&nbsp;are almost same, you get the same high from the free fall, the only difference is after you jump, you get the swing. See you jump from the same structure, with a rope tied to your waist, once your jump, you fall freely for 80 m and the rope gets tight and you start oscillating to and fro for 10-15 times across the river. I said yes, let's do it. He explained all the rules and warned us if something bad happens they are not responsible for it. I had to pay Rs 3500 and I was told I would be given two chances. If I get scared and could not jump for the first time, they would coach us it is ok, nothing will happen, you won't&nbsp;die and they would give&nbsp;a second chance. If I miss the second opportunity my money as well my chance will be gone. I understood the rule, as it takes plenty of time to make one prepare for the jump. I saw some more videos and understood every detail. Once I paid the money, I was scared as there was no way to back out now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my time came, I went to the tall structure, where all jumping takes place, I was questioning myself why did I agree to do it? Maybe it is not too late, I can back out. It was same nervousness that I generally get before public speaking. I was talking to some guys and girls who were supposed to take the jump before me. I gathered courage while talking to them, they are normal humans, someone studying, someone with a job. If they can why can't I?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My turn soon came and an Australian lady was preparing me. I asked her I won't die right innocently. She said within next 15 min, I won't die, after that, it is not in her hand. She has a good sense of humor.&nbsp; She explained to me all the rules, tied the rope and backup rope and suggested me, don't look down, look straight and take the jump.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was terrified, but I gathered courage and on their green signal, I took the leap of faith and jumped looking straight. I was terrified beyond imagination, the free fall of 80 meters seems to me forever although it lasted only 5-6 second. Everything was in slow motion. I could not describe it in words, it was like a high, an adrenaline rush I never experienced before. I never felt so free, I felt like a bird far from the confinement and constraint of the world.&nbsp;I was screaming as loud as I could and I felt my soul was out of my body. Once I reached down, the rope tightened as I started screaming "I did it, I did it."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started swinging once the rope was tight and the beauty was breathtaking. I could see the river down me and it all seemed too peaceful. While swinging I covered 5-6 time the river from the air again and again. I started to come down, as soon as I reached down, I jumped in the small river, washed my face and drank water. I felt like a warrior who just won the entire world by his courage !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the time I reached the reception, my video was ready. I was watching it again and again and I still reliving the moment. It was the same joy, what you feel after overcoming a tremendous battle, which you thought you can never win. After that, I went for river rafting in Rishikesh and did cliff jumping where you have to jump from a 20-meter high rock into the water. I was so psyched after giant swing I did the jump 3-4 times. It was the most adventurous day of my life and I will remember it till the end of my life.</p>
